  "ai_explanation": "<section>\n  <p>Here are past input digits that were correctly labeled and are similar to yours:</p>\n  <p>• Left: Clear top ‘head’ (立) at the lower end (short flipped roof + descending spine). Above it, the wing section (羽) appears as a stacked, boxy grid attached to the spine, ending in a tapering lower stroke—a common oracle-style way to render the feathers and tail.</p>\n  <p>• Middle: The vertical spine (立) is straighter and more central, with two internal crossbars. The upper half shows a segmented wing (羽); although the cells are elongated, you still see three stacked compartments and a slight curved tail at the top.</p>\n  <p>• Right: Most compressed variant: the bottom head (立) is compact, split into small upper cells; above it the wing (羽) shows as two boxes plus a pointed lower panel, with a pronounced downward taper along the left edge—the same spine/tail geometry of 翌.</p>\n</section>",
